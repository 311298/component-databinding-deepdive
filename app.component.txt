=================================================================================

note : ng g c --skip-tests=true componentName -> to not create the spec.ts file

64.
breaked the AppComponent into 2 component like cockpit component and server-element component.
And will be using the input and output between the child and parent component.

65.
oveview of property and data binding

66.
when we try to apply the for loop inside of the component tag, few things to remember.
1st list must be defined inside the component where you are apply, means app.html and app.ts have list definition.
2nd when we will do property binding known element inside the component tag must be defined or else error.
@Input( ) variable -> when we apply the input decorator before the variable now it will be accessible to the parent component of that particular component.
To show it we need the property binding [variable in child component]="variable from parent component"

67.
@Input('alias') [alias]="expression".

69.
first we saved data in 2 variables named newservername and newservercontent.
two different function were assigned for 2 different button.
2 custom output event are created using @Output() nameofevent= new eventemitter<type and data need to passed for example string or complex one is {key1:type1,key2:type2}>.
on function we need to emit those by calling eventemitter varaiable and emit it.
one thing to note that where we output that event must have same type or else data will not render.
things to remember is all the action of input and output is done on child component
