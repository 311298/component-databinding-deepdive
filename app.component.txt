when we try to apply the for loop inside of the component tag, few things to remember.
1st list must be defined inside the component where you are apply, means app.html and app.ts have list definition.
2nd when we will do property binding known element inside the component tag must be defined or else error.
@Input( ) variable -> when we apply the input decorator before the variable now it will be accessible to the parent component of that particular component.
To show it we need the property binding [variable in child component]="variable from parent component"
